Club Lime provides a way to explore all of the classes that they have scheduled [(Club Lime classes)](https://www.clublime.com.au/classes/), but it's quite clunky to explore if you're interested in multiple gym locations or session types. Fortunately, you can download all upcoming scheduled classes as a CSV file.

This website makes it easier to explore the scheduled classes.

Once it's complete, I plan to deploy it (likely on Fly.io).

## todo

- options above the table where we can select which locations and which workouts we are interested in
- filter the table by the chosen options
- want to generate the index page once per day when we fetch the new csv and then just serve this generated page
- settings page where we can cut down the list of locations and workouts that get shown on the main page as options
- actually source the rawData automatically
