Club Lime provides a way to explore all of the classes that they have scheduled [(Club Lime classes)](https://www.clublime.com.au/classes/), but it's quite clunky to explore if you're interested in multiple gym locations or session types. Fortunately, you can download all upcoming scheduled classes as a CSV file.

This website makes it easier to explore the scheduled classes.

## todo

- options above the table where we can select which locations and which workouts we are interested in
- filter the table by the chosen options
- want to generate the index page once per day when we fetch the new csv and then just serve this generated page
- settings page where we can cut down the list of locations and workouts that get shown on the main page as options
- source the raw data CSV from club lime, register a fly volume and write and read the raw data from there
- might be cool to store the raw data CSV once per day
- unfortunately the csv doesn't include data on which classes are full and which are cancelled, but I think we might be able to get this information actually
- pottenntially possible to make the classes clickable and take you to club lime to view and book, but I'm not sure about that.
